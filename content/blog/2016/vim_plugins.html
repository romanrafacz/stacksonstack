<p>Awesome Vim plugins that will make your life easier</p>


<p>
With so many tools out there it's hard to keep track of all of them, here are a few that you should keep up your sleeve
</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">vim-pathogen</a></li>

<p>
Most of these are provided by tpope via github who has created some cool plugins.  Pathogen makes installing these types of plugins a breeze.  Once you add pathogen into your your vimrc, you're able to quickly add other plugins into your enviroment by dropping them in the the bundle folder in .vim.

<li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git">vim-sensible</a></li>

<p>
Vim-Sensible is a good starting point to your .vimrc, especially if you're new to vim.  Ultimately you'll want to roll your own so you know exactly what you'll get but if you ain't got no time for that, start here.

<p>
If you're using multiple split screens with vim, tmux allows you to navigate a bit better.
