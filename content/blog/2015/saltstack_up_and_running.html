<p>
Th goal of this post is to have a working example of saltstack, a mighty fine configuration management tool written in python.</p>
<p>
We're going to setup a master server and a slave(minion) which we will be able to push all our states to.  <i>State</i> with the extention .sls is how
we are able to define what we went to exactly went want to happen to our minion.  We will define a user state that will define user profiles
across 1 server or 1000.
</p>
<p>
Saltstack also provides us with a really neat remote ssh execution tool which makes pushing out code to remote minions as.  I.E, you can just update 1 package
to a host of machines with one command.  We'll also commit our states to a Git repo so we can continue building out our states.
</p>

<p>
First thing you want to do is make sure you have salt-master installed on one of your system.  This is as easy as using the package manager on your
flavor of *nix.  Windows servers are not support as salt masters at the time of this wrting.

I will be using CentOS for this writeup.  I am also using two vagrant machines to make the process easier, you can checkout devops section if you're unsure.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
sudo yum install salt-master -y
</code>
</pre>

<p>Once salt-maste is install, we'll just quick setup some quick configurations.</br>
<li>Change the hostname to saltmaster</li>
<li>Create salt & pillar directory in /srv - <i>sudo mkdir -p /srv/{salt,pillar}</i></li>
</p>
<p>You dont have to change anything in the master configuration file unless you want to change the default location for your states.  Which I typically do 
You can find a complete breakdown: <a href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/configuration/master.html"><i>Here</i></a>
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
file_roots
  base:
    - /srv/salt/
    - /srv/salt/pillars
  dev:
    - /srv/salt/dev/services
    - /srv/salt/dev/states
  prod:
    - /srv/salt/prod/services
    - /srv/salt/prod/states
</code>
</pre>
<p>I should mention that saltstack to uses yaml searializtion for it's configuration, make sure to stick to this format</p>

<p>
<h2>Modify the Salt Minion</h2>
<p>Let's modify the salt minion and connect it to the salt master.</br>
<li>Rename the minions hostname(we'll use salt_minion)</li>
<li>Install saltstack</li>
<li>Edit /etc/salt/minion</li>
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>sudo yum install salt-minion -y</code>
</pre>
	
<li>Edit /etc/salt/minion</li>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>master: saltmaster or ip_address_of_master</code>
</pre>
<p>You could just put the ip_address_of_master or the hostname and edit the /etc/hosts file and hardcode the hostanme to the ipaddress.</p>
<p>Restart the minion, jump over to your saltmaster, let's see if any minions tried to sync to our master
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
sudo salt-key -L
</code>
</pre>
<p>Once you add the masters host ip and restart the minion, it will automatically try to connect to the master.  You will need to accept the minions key
to be able to communicate with each other.	
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
sudo salt-key -A
</code>
</pre>
<p>Accepting the minion's key by typing in Y and now you will be able to execute commands, here are a few that are useful. 
The first one will confirm if you can communicate with your minion.	
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
sudo salt '*' test.ping
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can issue commands directly to the minions, let install Vim.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
sudo salt '*' cmd.run 'sudo yum install vim -y'
</code>
</pre>

<p>How cools is that!  You now have a saltmaster that can control your infrastructure. Next post will dicuss setting up your states.</p>

<p>Bonus points: add the saltmasters .pub key to your minion configuration file in master_finger before key acceptance.  This will ensure you are connecting to the right server.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
sudo salt-key -F master
Local Keys:
master.pem:  e5:95:a8:88:8e:04:6a:93:51:e8:e0:18:26:1a:00:e4
master.pub:  65:86:de:a9:26:cb:07:24:bc:d4:c2:21:9b:ad:38:89
Accepted Keys:
salt_minion:  18:87:aa:21:af:4f:62:f3:59:83:66:17:75:54:5e:6b
</code>
</pre>

<p>Take the master pub finger key and put into you minion configuration file under master</p>
