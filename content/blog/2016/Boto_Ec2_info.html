<h1>Using Boto for EC2 instances</h1>
Python has a really neat library that allows you to grab all details of your E2 instances.  Furthermore you can get the details you want based on specific search patterns
</p>

<p>Here's a script that will give you the ip address's based on image_id.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
import os
import boto
from boto import ec2

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.enviorn['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.enviorn['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']

ec2conn = ec2.connection.EC2Connection(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

reservations = ec2conn.get_all_instances()
instances = [i for r in reservations for i in r.instances]

for i in instances:
	if (i.image_id == 'ami-xxxxxxx'):
		print i.ip_address
</code>
</pre>

<p>This will return the public ip address's, next we'll send out an email to who we specify via input.</p>
