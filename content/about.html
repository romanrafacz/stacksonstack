My name is Roman Rafacz and I work at Jack Morton Worldwide.  My main role is with the operations team developing 
event registrations, reporting tools, as well and work with Jack Morton Educaitonal Training delivering quality IT training.
Althogh my focus is on System Adminitration and cloud computing, I enjoy working on server side programming and full stack development.
I am continiously engulfing myself in Java, python, Postgresql, AngularJS, application servers, AWS and tools that make those jobs easier.
