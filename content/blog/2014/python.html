My top 10 python libraries
</br>
Some usefull libraries that have been helpful throughtout my learning process.
</p>

<p>
<h1>iPython</h1>
A very good tool to have when working in the command line. Not only for auto tab completions, history, and shell capabilities but one you type in a package, it will pull up
any available classes, methods, etc.. a musth have.
</p>

<p>
<h1>Requests</h1>
Request is a great tool for sending HTTP requests.  You can use use <i> x=requests.get(url)</i> and collect the result in a variable.  Then all you need to do is 
iterate through the resultes using x.content.  Very cool
</p>

<p>
<h1>SQLAlchemy</h1>
ORM for databases.  Couple that with Flask and you can create an persitant application.  SQLAlchemy does a lot of heavy lifting for you and sterilizes your input.
</p>

<p>
<h1>Django</h1>
Fairly popular framework, you may have heard of it.  Like SQLAlchemy above, does a lot heavy lifting for you so you can focus on coding.	
</p>

<p>
<h1>boto</h1>
A python interface to AWS, makes cloud computing in that environment much more enjoyable.
